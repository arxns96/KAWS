# KAWS Project with Figma designs and Front-End Web Development

I've always wanted to design and develop a landing page (just out of passion and interest) to show case my skills. 

I have used Semantics HTML tags and CSS3. 

I will be doing more soon. 

Thank you for looking into my work, I appreciate it a lot.

Take care,

Arun.S
